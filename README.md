Fractals and chaos
A fractal is a never-ending pattern. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop.

Fractal patterns are extremely familiar, since nature is full of fractals. For instance: trees, rivers etc.
